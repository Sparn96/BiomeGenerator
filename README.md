# BiomeGenerator
I mess around with some biome generator Ideas using a simple console app

This code is older and will probably only be used for reference 

#Explinaiton of what this project does

As of right now, this project is meant to test different methods / theories of biome distribution and creation. 

  -The current build works and provides random data, however there is an issue with moisture distribution. So the result is a lot of very dry biomes reguardless of temperature. 
  
  -There is a bug with the biome drawing on the map so it is very square
  
  -Moisure maps might be the next step, however this code is a reference for another upcoming project.
