#Testing biome distribution

Using this program is as simple as draging and droping the resulting .biome file the map generator spits out. 

The results of the test could be printed out in a text file and loaded into an excel program in order to see a more visual graph

I may or may not add this functionality depending on if I use this code as a base for another project. 

Again this code dump is mainly for reference.
